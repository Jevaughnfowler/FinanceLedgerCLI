# FinanceLedgerCLI!
Welcome to FinanceLedgerCLI, a Java-based command-line application that allows users to manage deposits, payments, and generate transaction reports—all within an interactive and intuitive terminal interface.

This is my first-ever solo project (Capstone), and it has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. As someone only three weeks into the Year Up  United Code Academy program, I faced plenty of uncertainty—like figuring out how to organize my code, structure the Main class more cleanly, and implement file-based persistence. But overcoming those challenges made the experience all the more meaningful.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into software development. There's much more to come, and I'm proud to share this as the first of many future projects.

Below, you'll find screenshots and details highlighting how the ledger works and the many features it offers. Enjoy!
